## Overview

A simple contact form using Flexbox and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
  Built a container to hold the form and add some padding. 

  I used flex and flexwrap, with a min-width of 250px, so that if both grow and shrinks together. Once it reaches its minimum width, it wraps and then grows to fill the remaining space. With this I do not need to use media queries, as it is responsive to all screen sizes. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### Continued development

Continue to do challenges to solidify skills.
